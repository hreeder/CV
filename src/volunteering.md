**Napier Video Gaming Society** _President_ <span class="subheading">December 2012 &dash; Ongoing</span>

During my first year of university I found that there was not a society for playing video games. At the time, the university had the Napier Analog Gaming Society, who were more focused on board games, but there was not somewhere for students to play video games in a social setting.

To remedy this, along with a group of roughly ten others, I helped found the Video Gaming Society, preparing it for it's first full academic year, beginning September 2013.

Since then, I have been re-elected as President each year as the society members felt I was doing the job well and were happy to keep me on.

**Napier Developers Society** _Committee Member & Founder_ <span class="subheading">November 2013 &dash; Ongoing</span>

On the academic side of things, I was approached by a colleague during my second year of university, to help found a society for students of the School of Computing at Napier. Through this, I helped out in the first year of it's operation, aiding the core committee members wherever necessary.

After my return to University following my work placement year, I have taken a more active role on the committee of the Developers Society, and I have helped organise speakers for tech talks, organise workshop evenings and am currently helping organise an inter-university event to be held in York University, in conjunction with HackSoc (York) and CompSoc (Edinburgh University).

The University of Edinburgh TARDIS Project is a student run computing facility, made available to staff and students of The University of Edinburgh. The TARDIS project exists to give students the ability to gain experience in running and maintaining a computer network. It also serves to give students a space to do projects which they would not normally be able to on the regular university computing network.


**EVE Online Alliances** _DevOps Engineer_ <span class="subheading">November 2013 &dash; March 2014, June 2014 &dash; August 2014</span>

As a lover of the video game EVE Online, I have been involved with two alliances where I have been in a development and systems operations role. Tasks here varied from simple server maintenance, including being on-call for emergencies, to development of extra tools to help the group function. During both periods where I was involved with these roles, I was delivering services to roughly 4-500 other players, ensuring smooth access to voice and text communications.
