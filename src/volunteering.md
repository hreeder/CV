**EVE Online Alliances** _DevOps Engineer_ <span class="subheading">November 2013 &dash; March 2014, June 2014 &dash; August 2014</span>

As a lover of the video game EVE Online, I have been involved with two alliances where I have been in a development and systems operations role. Tasks here varied from simple server maintenance, including being on-call for emergencies, to development of extra tools to help the group function. During both periods where I was involved with these roles, I was delivering services to roughly 4-500 other players, ensuring smooth access to voice and text communications.
